## Socks Shop Deployment with Terraform and Ansible: A Detailed Guide

This document outlines the deployment process for the Socks Shop application, utilizing Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for application deployment and configuration.

### 1. Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

#### 1.1. Overview

Terraform is used to automate the creation of the required AWS resources, including an EKS cluster, a PostgreSQL database, and storage volumes. This ensures a consistent and repeatable infrastructure setup.

#### 1.2. Configuration

* **`main.tf`:** This file defines the AWS resources to be provisioned, including:
    * **EKS Cluster:** Creates a managed Kubernetes cluster within AWS.
    * **PostgreSQL Database:** Provisions a PostgreSQL database instance for the application's data storage.
    * **Storage Volumes:** Creates EBS volumes for persistent storage of application data.
    * **Networking:** Configures VPC, subnets, security groups, and routing tables for network connectivity.
* **`variables.tf`:** Defines variables for configurable settings, allowing customization of the deployment.
* **`outputs.tf`:** Defines outputs that provide access to important information about the provisioned resources, such as the Kubernetes API endpoint, database connection details, and VPC ID.

#### 1.3. Execution

1. **Initialization:** Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform workspace and download necessary provider plugins.
2. **Deployment:** Execute `terraform apply` to provision the infrastructure based on the configuration in `main.tf`. This will create the AWS resources defined in the configuration.
3. **Output Retrieval:** Use `terraform output` to retrieve the values of the outputs defined in `outputs.tf`. This information will be used in the Ansible deployment process.

### 2. Application Deployment with Ansible

#### 2.1. Overview

Ansible is used to automate the deployment and configuration of the Socks Shop application within the provisioned Kubernetes cluster.

#### 2.2. Configuration

* **`inventory.yml`:** Defines the inventory of hosts that Ansible will manage. In this case, it includes the Kubernetes API endpoint, retrieved from Terraform outputs.
* **`socks-shop.yml`:** This Ansible playbook contains tasks for deploying the Socks Shop application:
    * **Namespace Creation:** Creates a dedicated Kubernetes namespace for the application.
    * **Deployment:** Deploys the various components of the Socks Shop application as Kubernetes deployments and services.
    * **Configuration:** Configures the application components, including database connection details retrieved from Terraform outputs.
    * **Ingress Setup:** Configures an ingress controller to expose the application to external users.
* **`vault.yml`:** This file stores sensitive information, such as database credentials, encrypted using Ansible Vault.

#### 2.3. Execution

1. **Inventory Setup:** Update the `inventory.yml` file with the Kubernetes API endpoint retrieved from Terraform outputs.
2. **Playbook Execution:** Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml --ask-vault-pass socks-shop.yml` to execute the Ansible playbook. This will deploy the Socks Shop application within the Kubernetes cluster.

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting with Prometheus

#### 3.1. Overview

Prometheus is used to monitor the health and performance of the Socks Shop application and the Kubernetes cluster.

#### 3.2. Configuration

* **Prometheus Operator:** Deploys the Prometheus Operator, which manages Prometheus instances and related components.
* **Prometheus Instance:** Creates a Prometheus instance to scrape metrics from the application and cluster.
* **Alertmanager:** Configures an Alertmanager to handle alerts generated by Prometheus.
* **Service Monitors:** Defines service monitors to tell Prometheus which services to scrape metrics from.
* **Alerting Rules:** Defines rules that trigger alerts when certain conditions are met, such as high request latency or service failures.

#### 3.3. Execution

1. **Deployment:** Deploy the Prometheus Operator, Prometheus instance, Alertmanager, and service monitors using Ansible.
2. **Alerting:** Configure alerting rules within Prometheus to monitor for critical conditions and send notifications.
